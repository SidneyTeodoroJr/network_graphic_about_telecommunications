# network_graphic_about_telecommunications

In this project, we create a fictitious network with five nodes representing websites, each with a numerical value representing the number of unique visitors. The five edges connecting the nodes represent connections between sites. This allows the network to be visualized graphically, showing the relationship between the sites and their respective visitor numbers.
